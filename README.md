# My-Note-Taker-App

#Note App 
I was asked to use preexisting code to create a note taker app. The app will allow a user the ability to view notes, add new notes and delete already existing notes by the usage of GET, POST and DELETE Routes.

## Installation

1. I used HTML, CSS AND JavaScript.
2. Additionally I made use of the following node packages.:
    1. Express-For creation of API Routes
    2. utils-For installations of modules for my project.
    3. uuid-For unique user identification
    4. nodemon-For the quick restart of my server.
1. I deployed my project using render. A link and screenshot are provided below:
